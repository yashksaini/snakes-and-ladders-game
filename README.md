## About the Project

Once the players have customized their avatars, the game begins on the game board screen. The game board features a grid of 100 numbered boxes, each representing a unique position on the board. The board is adorned with numerous snakes and ladders, which are the focal points of excitement and challenge.

Players take turns rolling the dice by clicking on it when it's their active turn. The game intelligently moves each player's avatar according to the dice value. If a player lands on a ladder's base, they automatically ascend to the top, skipping ahead. Conversely, if they land on a snake's head, they slide down to the tail, presenting a setback.

The project incorporates captivating sound effects that enhance the gameplay experience. From the rattle of the dice to the triumphant victory jingle, these audio cues immerse players in the game's ambiance. The project's codebase, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensures a smooth and responsive user interface.
